# Path planning for point robot using Djikstra's path planning algorithm

Djikstra's algorithm is an extension of the BFS algorithm with the added weights for child nodes to be explored. For this implementation, the chosen weight is the Euclidean distance.

## How to run the code

This is the submission for the class ENPM - 661 - Planning for Autonomous Robots.

To run the file, simply sun as you would normally run a python file. An output file names 'test_case_1_info.txt' will be created for test case 1 and same for test case 2.

To check different samples, the sample cases can be manually changed.
